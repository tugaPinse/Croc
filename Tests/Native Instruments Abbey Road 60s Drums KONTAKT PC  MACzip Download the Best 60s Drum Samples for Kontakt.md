## Downloading and Installing Native Instruments Abbey Road 60s Drums KONTAKT
 
The first step is to download the Native Instruments Abbey Road 60s Drums KONTAKT library from the official website[^1^]. You will need to create an account and register your product to access the download link. The library size is about 6.3 GB, so make sure you have enough space on your hard drive.
 
Once you have downloaded the library, you will need to unzip it using a program like WinZip or WinRAR. You will get a folder called "Abbey Road 60s Drums" that contains the KONTAKT files and documentation. You can place this folder anywhere on your computer, but we recommend keeping it in a dedicated folder for your KONTAKT libraries.
 
The next step is to install the free KONTAKT PLAYER or KONTAKT if you don't have it already. You can download it from the Native Instruments website[^2^]. Follow the instructions to install and activate it on your computer. You will also need to install the Native Access application, which is a tool that manages your Native Instruments products and updates.
 
After installing KONTAKT PLAYER or KONTAKT, you will need to add the Abbey Road 60s Drums library to it. To do this, open Native Access and go to the "Not installed" tab. Click on "Add a serial" and enter the serial number that came with your product. Then click on "Browse" and locate the "Abbey Road 60s Drums" folder that you unzipped earlier. Click on "OK" and then on "Install". This will add the library to your KONTAKT browser and make it ready to use.
 
## Using Native Instruments Abbey Road 60s Drums KONTAKT
 
To use Native Instruments Abbey Road 60s Drums KONTAKT, you will need to open KONTAKT PLAYER or KONTAKT as a standalone application or as a plug-in in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Then go to the browser and find the "Abbey Road 60s Drums" folder under the "Libraries" tab. You will see two subfolders: "Early 60s Kit" and "Late 60s Kit". These are the two drum kits that are included in the library: a Gretsch Round Badge kit from the early 60s and a Ludwig Hollywood kit from 1967.
 
You can load either of these kits by double-clicking on them or dragging them onto the rack. This will open the main interface of Abbey Road 60s Drums, which consists of four pages: Drum Kit, Mixer, Groove Library and Options. You can switch between these pages by clicking on their icons at the top of the interface.
 
The Drum Kit page shows you a graphical representation of the drum kit that you have loaded. You can click on any drum or cymbal to hear how it sounds. You can also adjust some parameters for each drum, such as volume, tuning, damping, mic bleed and snare wires. You can also choose between two snare options for each kit: a Ludwig Jazz Festival snare or a Ludwig Mahogany snare for the early 60s kit, and a Ludwig Supra-Phonic 400 snare or a Radio King snare for the late 60s kit.
