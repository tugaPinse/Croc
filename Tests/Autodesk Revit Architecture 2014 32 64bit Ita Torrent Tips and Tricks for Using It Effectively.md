# Autodesk Revit Architecture 2014: A Powerful Software for Building Design
 
Autodesk Revit Architecture 2014 is a software that allows you to design and document buildings in 3D. It is part of the Autodesk Revit family of products, which also includes Revit Structure and Revit MEP. Revit Architecture 2014 is based on the concept of Building Information Modeling (BIM), which means that you can create a digital model of your building that contains all the information you need for construction, analysis, and visualization.
 
Some of the features of Revit Architecture 2014 are:

- Parametric components: You can create and modify components that are driven by parameters, such as dimensions, materials, and properties. This allows you to create custom elements that adapt to changes in the model.
- Worksharing: You can collaborate with other users on the same project using a central file that stores the model data. You can also use worksets to divide the model into logical units and control access and visibility.
- Schedules and annotations: You can create tables and notes that display information from the model, such as quantities, dimensions, and specifications. You can also link schedules to external data sources, such as Excel files.
- Rendering and visualization: You can create realistic images and animations of your model using the built-in rendering engine or external applications. You can also use walkthroughs and sun studies to explore your design from different perspectives and times of day.

If you want to learn more about Revit Architecture 2014, you can check out the official website[^3^] or the book Autodesk Revit Architecture 2014: No Experience Required[^2^].

If you want to get started with Revit Architecture 2014, you can follow some of the tutorials that are available online. For example, you can learn how to create a basic wall[^3^], how to place doors and windows[^1^], how to create a 3D view[^2^], and more. These tutorials will guide you step by step through the process of creating a simple building model using Revit Architecture 2014.
 
Alternatively, you can also enroll in a video course that covers the fundamentals of Revit Architecture 2014. One such course is Learning Revit Architecture 2014 by Infinite Skills[^2^]. This course consists of over 100 lectures and 11 hours of video content that will teach you how to use the core architectural tools of Revit. You will learn how to work with columns, walls, floors, roofs, ceilings, stairs, railings, rooms, families, schedules, annotations, rendering, and more. You will also learn how to collaborate with other users using worksharing and worksets.
