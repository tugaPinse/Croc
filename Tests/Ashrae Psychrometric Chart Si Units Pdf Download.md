The ASHRAE Psychrometric Chart SI Units PDF Download is a useful tool for engineers, designers, and students who need to analyze the thermodynamic properties of moist air and its processes. The chart shows the relationships between dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, specific humidity, enthalpy, and other psychrometric variables. The chart can be used to plot various psychrometric processes such as heating, cooling, humidifying, dehumidifying, mixing, and more.
 
In this article, we will explain how to use the ASHRAE Psychrometric Chart SI Units PDF Download to perform some common psychrometric calculations and applications.

## How to Download the ASHRAE Psychrometric Chart SI Units PDF
 
The ASHRAE Psychrometric Chart SI Units PDF Download is available from the ASHRAE website[^1^]. You can either purchase a 50-sheet pad or a laminated chart of the chart in SI units. Alternatively, you can download the ASHRAE Psychrometric Chart App for your iOS device[^2^], which includes both I-P and SI units and allows you to plot points and processes on the screen. You can also purchase the Psychrometric Analysis CD, Version 7[^2^], which includes all five of ASHRAE's I-P unit psychrometric charts and all seven SI psychrometric charts. The CD also includes a program that allows you to plot processes and perform energy calculations on-screen.
  
## How to Read the ASHRAE Psychrometric Chart SI Units PDF
 
The ASHRAE Psychrometric Chart SI Units PDF shows the following psychrometric variables and their corresponding curves on the chart:
 
- Dry-bulb temperature (T<sub>db</sub>): The horizontal axis of the chart. It represents the temperature of moist air measured by a thermometer with a dry bulb.
- Wet-bulb temperature (T<sub>wb</sub>): The curved lines that slope downward from left to right. It represents the temperature of moist air measured by a thermometer with a wet bulb that is cooled by evaporation.
- Relative humidity (RH): The curved lines that are nearly horizontal at high temperatures and slope upward at low temperatures. It represents the ratio of the actual water vapor pressure in moist air to the saturation water vapor pressure at the same dry-bulb temperature.
- Specific humidity (Ï): The straight lines that slope upward from left to right. It represents the mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air in moist air.
- Enthalpy (h): The straight lines that are nearly horizontal at low specific humidities and slope upward at high specific humidities. It represents the total energy per unit mass of moist air, including both sensible and latent heat.
- Dew-point temperature (T<sub>dp</sub>): The locus of points where the wet-bulb temperature curve and the 100% relative humidity curve intersect. It represents the temperature at which moist air becomes saturated when cooled at constant pressure.
- Saturation curve: The upper boundary of the chart. It represents the condition of moist air when it is saturated with water vapor at a given dry-bulb temperature.

To read any psychrometric property from the chart, you need to locate a point on the chart that corresponds to a known condition of moist air. For example, if you know the dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity of moist air, you can find the point on the chart where the horizontal line for dry-bulb temperature intersects with the curved line for relative humidity. From this point, you can read other properties such as wet-bulb temperature, specific humidity, enthalpy, and dew-point temperature by following the corresponding curves on the chart.
